# ⚔️ Shadows of Vor'thaan

A dark fantasy action/adventure browser RPG built with **React + Vite**. No external game libraries — all logic, audio, and UI are hand-crafted.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- **Explore** 6 unique locations across a cursed land
- **Battle** 10 enemy types in turn-based combat, including a final boss
- **Level up** — gain XP to grow HP, ATK, and DEF automatically
- **Equip** weapons and armor from the shop (5 tiers each)
- **Use items** like potions and elixirs in and out of battle
- **Defend** to halve incoming damage on the next hit
- **Flee** from battles (60% success rate)
- **Complete quests** from the Tavern notice board for bonus gold and XP
- **Save progress** across 3 independent save slots with auto-save

## 💾 Save System

- **3 save slots** — each slot is independent and never overwrites another
- **Auto-save** triggers after every meaningful action (travel, battle, purchase, level-up)
- **Retry on death** — reloads your slot with HP fully restored
- **Victory clears the slot** — beating the game automatically deletes the winning save so the slot is free for a new run
- Slot data stored in `localStorage` under versioned keys (`vorhaan_save_v1_slot1` etc.)

## 🎵 Audio System

All audio is procedurally generated via the **Web Audio API** — no audio files needed.

### Music tracks

| Track | Plays during |
|-------|-------------|
| Title | Title, Game Over, Victory screens |
| Explore | World exploration |
| Battle | Regular enemy combat |
| Boss | Shadow King encounter |

### Sound effects

Attack, critical hit, taking damage, heal, level-up fanfare, victory, death, purchase, flee, travel, menu click. Access volume controls via the 🎵 button in the HUD. Settings persist between sessions.
