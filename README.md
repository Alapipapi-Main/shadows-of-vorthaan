# ⚔️ Shadows of Vor'thaan

A dark fantasy action/adventure browser RPG built with **React + Vite**. No external game libraries — all logic, audio, and UI are hand-crafted.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- **Explore** 7 unique locations across a cursed land
- **Battle** 13 enemy types in turn-based combat, including a final boss with multiple attack phases
- **Level up** — at every odd level (3, 5, 7, 9, 11...) a skill tree popup lets you choose a permanent perk — until all paths are mastered
- **Status effects** — Poison, Burn, and Stun affect both players and enemies
- **Dodge mechanic** — Phantom Knights phase through attacks; Evasion Tonic gives you the same ability
- **Craft items** at Gregor's Forge — combine Leather Scrap and Glowmoss into salves, wraps, draughts, and more
- **Loot drops** — enemies have a 40% chance to drop materials or consumables from their location
- **Equip** weapons and armor from the shop (5 tiers each)
- **Use items** like potions, elixirs, antidotes, venom vials, and flame scrolls in battle
- **Defend** to reduce incoming damage on the next hit
- **Flee** from battles (60% success rate, 100% with Shadowstep perk)
- **Complete quests** from the Tavern notice board for bonus gold and XP
- **World Map** — animated SVG map showing all 7 locations with fog of war, travel by clicking reachable nodes
- **Full battle log** — expand the battle log during combat to see the complete history of the fight
- **Bestiary** — discover all 13 enemy types, track kill counts and first encounter dates

## 🏆 Achievements & Bestiary

Press the **🏆** button in the HUD to open the panel. Achievements persist across all runs in a separate `localStorage` key — erasing a save slot never resets them.

### 📖 Bestiary
The Bestiary tab shows every enemy in the game. Undiscovered enemies appear as **???** until you fight them. Each entry shows level, your kill count, and first encounter date.

## 💾 Save System

- **3 save slots** — each slot is independent and never overwrites another
- **Auto-save** triggers after every meaningful action
- **Retry on death** — reloads your slot with HP fully restored
- **Victory clears the slot** automatically

## 🎵 Audio System

All audio is procedurally generated via the **Web Audio API** — no audio files needed.
